This is a simple web application for computing and visualizing CPU scheduling algorithms.
It supports the following algorithms:

- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Priority Scheduling (PRIO)
- Preemptive Priority (PRE-PRIO)
- Round Robin Scheduling (RR)
